Convolutional neural networks are very general and very powerful. As an example, consider Ilya Kostrikov and Tobias Weyand’s ChronoNet, a CNN that guesses the year in which a photo was taken. Since public sources can provide large numbers of digitally archived photos taken over the past century with known dates, it’s relatively straightforward to obtain labeled data (dated photos, in this case) with which to train this network.\nA breakthrough in building models for image classification came with the discovery that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be used to progressively extract higher- and higher-level representations of the image content. Instead of preprocessing the data to derive features like textures and shapes, a CNN takes just the image's raw pixel data as input and "learns" how to extract these features, and ultimately infer what object they constitute.
